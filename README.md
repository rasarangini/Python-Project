Feb 2024 - Feb 2024

Spearheaded a comprehensive project focusing on the Netflix dataset. This project equipped me with valuable skills in data analysis, data cleaning, and deriving actionable insights to drive business growth and cost-effectiveness strategies.

Initiated the analysis with an initial dataset of approximately 8800 rows, which expanded significantly to around 200,000 rows after thorough data cleaning and column unnesting.
Discovered that majority of content caters to adults and individuals above 14 years old, with dramas and international TV shows emerging as the most favoured genres.
Utilised data insights to pinpoint growth opportunities in countries like Canada and South Korea, despite the USA contributing to 42.7% , India and UK boasting the highest user bases.
Identified top search keywords such as "life","love",and "famili", with an average duration of 70-160 minutes per content piece.
Recommendation: Based on the gathered insights, it is advisable for Netflix to maintain a balanced approach by continuing to release both movies and TV shows. The inclusion of TV shows, especially those catered towards children, can significantly enhance user engagement over an extended period. It is crucial to consider user preferences for actors, directors, genres, and specific countries when planning new releases.
While observing a decline in the trend for both movies and TV shows after 2020, it is imperative to investigate and address the underlying reasons. Identifying and rectifying these issues could potentially reinvigorate the popularity of Netflix's content.
To enhance discoverability, incorporating top keywords into titles and descriptions is essential. Prioritizing countries with significant user bases, such as the USA, India, UK, Canada, and South Korea, can be a key focus for expanding and solidifying Netflix's presence in these regions.Spearheaded a comprehensive project focusing on the Netflix dataset.
